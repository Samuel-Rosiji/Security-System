This project showcases a secure access control system developed using Java and Arduino, featuring:

4-Digit Touch Sensor Input: Users enter a 4-digit passcode via a touch sensor. The system verifies the input against a pre-set code to grant or deny access.
Error Feedback: An OLED display provides visual feedback for incorrect passcodes, while a buzzer and LEDs alert users to failed attempts.
Manual Override: A bypass button allows authorized personnel to manually override the system, displaying an override message for transparency.
Real-Time Feedback: The OLED display communicates system status, ensuring users are informed at every step.
Event-Driven Programming: The system uses event listeners for responsive input handling and quick feedback, ensuring seamless operation.
